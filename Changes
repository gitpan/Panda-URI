0.1.3    09.12.2014
           - fix a bug which could make query_string and query hash out of sync
             after using param()/multiparam() methods
0.1.2    05.12.2014
           - remove debugging flag from Makefile.PL
0.1.1    04.12.2014
           - bugfix: corrupted url strings (with null bytes) might cause core dumps.
             now null-bytes immediately stop parsing as if it was the end of the url string.
           - added bool operator overloading, to prevent calling more expensive to_string()
             in conditions like: if ($uri) {}
0.1.0    26.11.2014
           - first release
